    <h1>Privacy Policy for Steam Deal Finder</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date]</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Steam Deal Finder ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our Chrome extension.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Steam Deal Finder does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data from its users.</p>

    <h2>Extension Settings</h2>
    <p>Your preferences for the "Minimum Discount" and "Minimum Review Score" are stored locally on your computer using the <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> API. This data is synced to your Google Account if you have Chrome sync enabled, allowing your settings to be consistent across your devices. This data is not accessed by or transmitted to us.</p>

    <h2>Website Data</h2>
    <p>The extension reads data directly from the Steam search results page (store.steampowered.com/search/*) to filter and highlight deals. This data is processed locally within your browser and is never sent to any external server.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
